<h1>The 12 Biggest Spring/Summer 2021 Trends</h1>
<p style="margin-top:30px;">You could be forgiven for thinking that the spring/summer 2021 collections – and the subsequent raft of spring/summer<br>
2021 trends – were something of a damp squib. Certainly, thanks to the ongoing pandemic, it was a season like no other.</p>
<p style="margin-top:50px;">Of the four fashion capitals, New York and <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/gallery/midriff-flossing-ss21-trend" target="_blank" title="vogue - London">
<strong>London</strong></a> opted for predominantly digital showcases, with the odd designer hosting<br>
<a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/tags/coronavirus" target="_blank" title="vogue - Coronavirus">
<strong>Covid-secure</strong></a> presentations for small numbers of press and buyers; while Milan and <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/paris-fashion-week-ss21-verdict" target="_blank" title="vogue - Paris">
<strong>Paris</strong></a> held scaled-back showings with strict<br>
social distancing measures in place from some of its biggest brands. Others still opted to try something different.<br>
“Different” manifested variously as: showing off-schedule, <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/fashion-film-renaissance" target="_blank" title="vogue - showing via">
<strong>showing via film</strong></a> and in virtual reality, or sending a replacement<br>
for a catwalk experience out to press and buyers in a box. All enjoyed varying degrees of success.</p>

<p style="margin-top:60px;">As for the biggest spring/summer 2021 trends? The new working-from-home routine certainly had an effect on what<br>
designers turned out. How else to explain the mood for <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/gallery/bralette-trend-ss21" target="_blank" title="bralettes"><strong>bralettes</strong></a> and midriff flossing? (Beware: both trends require<br>
either a fairly militant home workout regime, and/or buoyant levels of self-confidence.)<br>
Away from the underwear-as-outerwear impulse came comfort: wide-leg trousers made for bold strides; floaty,<br>
sheer maxi dresses promised easy glamour; and ladylike ensembles pimped with a touch of sportswear felt suitably modern<br>
(think prim pleated skirts with hoodies, <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/gallery/prada-ss21-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" title="as seen at Prada"><strong>as seen at prada</strong></a>, tea dresses with cagoules, <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/gallery/celine-ss21-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" title="as seen at celine"><strong>as seen at Celine</strong></a>, and pencil skirts with<br>
bomber jackets, as seen at Max Mara).</p>
